text='''a cyclone (/ˈsaɪ.kloʊn/) is a large air mass that rotates around
a strong center of low atmospheric pressure, counterclockwise in the
Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere as viewed
from above (opposite to an anticyclone).[1][2] Cyclones are
characterized by inward-spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low
pressure.[3][4]

Cyclones have also been seen on planets other than the Earth, such as
Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune.[5][6] Cyclogenesis is the process of cyclone
formation and intensification.[7]

Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced
mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones
contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and
intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones occlude
as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems.
A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle
by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.'''
